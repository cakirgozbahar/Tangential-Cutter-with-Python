## ABSTRACT
In this project, I transform a 3D Printer into a Tangential Cutter in the hardware-wise so that it will be able to cut custom stickers.
On the other hand, in the software-wise, I read some graphics from external files with the programming language Python, and translate the graphics into the 3D Printer's language.
